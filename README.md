PROJECT TITLE : VISUALIZING AND PREDICTING HEART DISEASES WITH AN INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD

Many approaches were suggested for prediction of heart disease, but none of them were satisfactory in clinical terms. Day by day the cases of heart diseases are increasing at a rapid rate and it's very Important and concerning to predict any such diseases beforehand. This diagnosis is a difficult task i.e. it should be performed precisely and efficiently.This project proposes a prediction model to predict whether a person has a heart disease or not and visualize the predicted result  using a dashboard.

It is a web application which is able to predict the presence and state of heart diseases using the patients' readings and also provide an analysis, overview of their health over a period of time.
